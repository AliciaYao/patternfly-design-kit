# Patternfly Design Kit

The PatternFly Design Kit is a collection of [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) assets that make it easy for designers to create high-fidelity design mockups that accurately represent [PatternFly](http://patternfly.org) components and layouts. It includes:

* A Sketch symbol library that includes components, icons, color palettes, and other PatternFly elements. Hosted on Sketch Cloud here: https://sketch.cloud/s/7do0P
* A template file that provides several starter layouts that will make it easier to construct common PatternFly screens. Hosted on Sketch Cloud here: https://sketch.cloud/s/nwY34

## Updating the kit
Sketch will automatically receive library updates in the top, right corner of an open Sketch file. You'll want to update the PatternFly library **and** update the symbols within your file (two separate notifications). You'll have to update **all** files that are using PatternFly symbols - it is not a one and done process, unfortunately.

To update you PatternFly Template file, open the updated template from your local repo and select **File > Save as Template...** This will replace the current template with the updated version and make the latest layouts available using the **New from Template...** feature.

## Filing bugs
If something isn't working as expected with the library or template file, please file an issue in this repo and label it with "bug". We should be able to fix it within a couple days! 

## Contributing to the PatternFly Design Kit
We welcome contributions from our community of PatternFly designers. There are issues in the backlog that are up for grabs if not already assigned. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact Gina Doyle [gdoyle@redhat.com](mailto:gdoyle@redhat.com).
