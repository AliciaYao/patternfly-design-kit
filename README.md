# Patternfly Design Kit

The PatternFly Design Kit is a collection of [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) assets that make it easy for designers to create high-fidelity design mockups that accurately represent [PatternFly](http://patternfly.org) components and layouts. It includes:

* A Sketch symbol library that includes components, icons, color palettes, and other PatternFly elements.
* A template file that provides several starter layouts that will make it easier to construct common PatternFly screens.

By using these file to create your designs, mockups will always be kept up to date with the latest PatternFly styling as Skecth will automatically notify you of any symbol changes when you open a Skecth source file that was created using the library. We recommend using the design kit any time you need to create high-fidelity product mockups using Sketch. 

## Get Started with the PatternFly Design Kit

### Working with Sketch Libraries
Libraries were introduced in Skecth 47 as a tools for creating custom symbols that can be shared across a variety of projects. You must have Sketch version 47 or above installed to use this capability. You can read more about the capabilities of Sketch Libraries here: https://www.sketchapp.com/docs/libraries/.

### First Time Setup and Installation
To use the Design Kit in Sketch, you'll first want to clone a copy of this repo to your local machine. The best way to do this is to follow a process similar to what you may have already done to set up for making PatternFly Design contributions. For this you will need [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) or a similar tool installed to maintain the local copy of this repo. If you have never set this up, we recommend reading [this article](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-design/wiki/How-to-Setup-your-Contribution-Environment) for more information about using GitHub with PatternFly Design. Once you have Sourcetree installed and connected to your GitHub account, you should follow these steps to clone this repo.

1. From the SourceTree main window, click on the Remote tab, scroll to 'patternfly/patternfly-design-kit' and click Clone. This will ask you for a directory where you would like the Design Kit files to live on your local machine. Upon clicking Clone, the files will be copied to your local drive.
2. In Sketch, open Preferences and click the Libraries tab. This will show you all the libraries that are installed in your instance of Sketch. Next click Add Library...
