# Patternfly Design Kit

The PatternFly Design Kit is a collection of [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) assets that make it easy for designers to create high-fidelity design mockups that accurately represent [PatternFly](http://patternfly.org) components and layouts. It includes:

* A Sketch symbol library that includes components, icons, color palettes, and other PatternFly elements.
* A template file that provides several starter layouts that will make it easier to construct common PatternFly screens.

By using these file to create your designs, mockups will always be kept up to date with the latest PatternFly styling as Skecth will automatically notify you of any symbol changes when you open a Skecth source file that was created using the library. We recommend using the design kit any time you need to create high-fidelity product mockups using Sketch. 

## Working with Sketch Libraries
Libraries were introduced in Skecth 47 as a tools for creating custom symbols that can be shared across a variety of projects. You must have Sketch version 47 or above installed to use this capability. You can read more about the capabilities of Sketch Libraries here: https://www.sketchapp.com/docs/libraries/.
